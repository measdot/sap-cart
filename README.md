# sap-cart - shipping cart based on Angular js and oojs

##Few points:
* As asked the assignment is done on AngularJS as the framework and OOJs for the rest.
* The responsive design has also been taken care of with good readability and user experience across devices.
* Ajax request/response, javascript code style, angular framework directory structure and angular features like factories, constants, controllers etc has been written considering the best practices and are totally as per the web standards. 

##Whats not done?
* The requirement (modal window updates on main page) is still buggy could not get time to debug it.
* Layout to be degrade gracefully for iPhone devices has not been taken care explicitly.
